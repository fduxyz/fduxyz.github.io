WelcomeÔºÅI am an Associate Professor at the Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired (ISTBI), Fudan University. Before coming to Fudan, I was a postdoctoral associate working in Emory University and Vanderbilt University. Recently, I have been working on the quantitative analysis of MRI and deep learning algorithms applied in the medical image analysis.

My research contains quantitative analysis of MRI---CEST and MRS, developing tool of brain atlas, and deep learning algorithms applied in medical image analysis (segmentation, cross domain transfer, interpretable machine learning) etc. My work has been published in Advanced Science, Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, Nano Letters, etc, as weel as MICCAI, ISMRM (oral) etc. I have a broad interest in deep learning algorithms applied in medical image analysis and quantitative MRI technology.

I am looking for self-motivated (undergraduate/graduate) students to conduct research on deep learning algorithms and MRI theory. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to contact me through e-mail.
